# Rollup rebuild test

## Rebuilding a commonjs module

I'm debugging an issue I'm experiencing with an internal commonjs dependency. For some reason rollup is struggling to produce the module as I expect and I want to simplify the build and the source code so I can test various scenarios

## running locally
- yarn
- yarn start
